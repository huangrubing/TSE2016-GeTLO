# GeTLO
This is an implementation of "Test Case Prioritization Using Lexicographical Ordering"

** This implementation is not extensively tested, and some of the files might be missing. Please let me know if you have any problems **

Start from GeTLO.m. It takes the coverage matrix and the depth parameter as the input and returns the ordering as the output.
